**Example 1:** `flipping_coins.ipynb`: Simple example highlighting the concepts of prior and likelihood construction, as well as the behaviour of the posterior under different data realisations

**Example 2:** `signal_estimation.ipynb`: Warm-up example for gravitational parameter inference, deonstrating numerical stability of log-likelihood, and the construction of corner plots

**Example 3:** `high_dimensions.ipynb`: Example highlihgting the scaling issues that happen when we try and do a grid-based approach for high-dimensional models
